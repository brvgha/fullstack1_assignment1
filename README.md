## Description
This is a web app called PlaceMark.
Users can signup, login, add a PoI, upload an image, and enter descriptive details about the POI.
The service also automatically pulls weather info and maps about the place as long as they are within the Geocode database.
There are also admin accounts that can see all information (excluding passwords), and delete any additions if needed.
